Tolkien\u2019s classic masterpieces behind the films...\r\n\r\nThis special 50th anniversary edition includes three volumes of The Lord of the Rings (The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King), along with an extensive new index\u2014a must-own tome for old and new Tolkien readers alike.\r\n\r\nOne Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins.\r\n\r\nFrom Sauron's fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and wide. Sauron gathered all the Great Rings to him, but always he searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion.\r\n\r\nWhen Bilbo reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to his young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom.\r\n\r\nThe Lord of the Rings tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of Gondor; and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider.\r\n\r\nJ.R.R. Tolkien (1892-1973), beloved throughout the world as the creator of The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion, was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, a fellow of Pembroke College, and a fellow of Merton College until his retirement in 1959. His chief interest was the linguistic aspects of the early English written tradition, but while he studied classic works of the past, he was creating a set of his own.","cover":"\/storage\/uploads\/1673096191_content.jfif","year":"2012","pages":"1216","quantity":"4","available":"4","updated_at":"2023-01-07T12:56:31.744000Z","created_at":"2023-01-07T12:56:31.744000Z"},{"_id":"63b96c9cb856d6bd35045223","title":"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind","author":"Yuval Noah Harari","genre":"History","description":"From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity\u2019s creation and evolution\u2014a #1 international bestseller\u2014that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be \u201chuman.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one\u2014homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?\r\n\r\nMost books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.\r\n\r\nDr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?\r\n\r\nFeaturing 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations\/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem.","cover":"\/storage\/uploads\/1673096348_0062316095.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_SX500_.jpg","year":"2015","pages":"464","quantity":"2","available":"2","updated_at":"2023-01-07T12:59:08.721000Z","created_at":"2023-01-07T12:59:08.721000Z"},{"_id":"63b96d12b856d6bd35045224","title":"Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones","author":"James Clear","genre":"Self development","description":"No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving--every day.
